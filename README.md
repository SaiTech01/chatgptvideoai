# ChatGPT Video Generator

The ChatGPT Video Generator is an AI-powered video generator that can generate videos with just a text as input. The generated video will have a simple animation of summary of the topic, with TTS (text to speech) using NodeJS to generate video. The video can also be downloaded. Currently, only a simple animation and can only be optimal for creating summary of a topic in a single or less words is available. We are working on towards adding more animation and making it usable for more purpose.
